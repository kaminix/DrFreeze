What killed the dinosaurs? The Ice Age!
Let's kick some ice!
Cool party!
Mercy? I'm afraid my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy.
Allow me to break the ice: My name is Freeze. Learn it well, for it's the chilling sound of your doom.
Tonight, hell freezes over!
In this universe, there's only one absolute... everything freezes!
Tonight's forecast... a freeze is coming!
The Ice Man cometh!
Freeze in hell, Batman!
You're not sending ME to the COOLER!
If I must suffer... Humanity will suffer with me! I shall repay them for sentencing me to a life without human comfort. I will blanket the city in endless winter! First... Gotham. And then... The world!
No matter what anyone tells you, Bane, it really is the size of your gun that counts.
I'm here to make your life a living hell. Prepare for a bitter harvest. Winter has come at last.
If revenge is a dish best served cold, then put on your Sunday finest. It's time to feast!
Hello. Sorry about the door. Is the party over?
Their bones will turn to ice! Their blood will freeze in my hands!
Can you be cold, Batman? You have eleven minutes to thaw a bird. What will you do? Chase the villain or save the boy? Your emotions make you weak. That's why this day is mine!
Watch the numbers, Batman, for they are the harbingers of your doom. Can you feel it coming? The icy cold of space! Ahh! At 30,000 feet, your heart will *freeze* and be no more!
Bombs away, Batman!
My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Aah. First, I will freeze the city, then I will hold Gotham ransom. Unless the city bows for my demands, it's winter forever in Gotham.
I need to get more diamonds from my hideout.
Chilled, to perfection.
Adam... and Evil.
