 **!rps** is simply rock, paper, scissors with a scoreboard. To play just type !rps followed by the weapon of your choice (or 'random').

To view your own and/or someone elses score, type !rps score followed by mentions of the people who's score you want to see.

Finally, you can view the top ten players by typing !rps score followed by one of the following categories (no category defaults to percentage):
- wins
- losses
- draws
- percentage
- total (number of games played)
